# ⚙️ Shell00 — Exercise 07 : diff

> **Turn-in directory:** `ex07/`  
> **File to submit:** `b`  
> **Allowed functions:** None  

---

## 🎯 Objective

Understand how to apply **differences between two files** using the `diff` and `patch` commands.

You’ll use a `.diff` file (generated by `diff`) as a *recipe of changes* that describes how to transform one file into another.

---

## 🧠 Concept Overview

When you run:
```bash
diff a b > sw.diff
````

you’re creating a file (`sw.diff`) that stores **difference instructions** — a step-by-step record of how `b` differs from `a`.

Later, the `patch` command can *read* those instructions and rebuild the modified version of `a` (which becomes `b`).

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Solution

```bash
# 1️⃣ Make sure both source files exist
# Expect to see: a  sw.diff
ls

# 2️⃣ Apply the patch instructions to create file b
patch a sw.diff -o b

# 3️⃣ Verify that file b was created correctly
cat b
```

## 🧩 Explanation of the command

| Component | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `patch`   | Applies modifications described in a diff file.       |
| `a`       | The original file (before the changes).               |
| `sw.diff` | File containing the difference instructions.          |
| `-o b`    | Output option — write the patched result to file `b`. |

---

## 🧮 Visual analogy

| Step | Description            | Result                                                            |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | `diff a b > sw.diff`   | Create the *recipe* (`sw.diff`) showing how `a` differs from `b`. |
| 2️⃣  | `patch a sw.diff -o b` | Apply the recipe to `a` to rebuild `b`.                           |

So `diff` discovers differences, and `patch` applies them.

---

## 🧾 Verification

To confirm your patch worked perfectly:

```bash
diff a b
```

If there’s **no output**, it means both files are now identical — success ✅

---

## 💡 Tips

* Both `a` and `sw.diff` must be in the **same directory**.
* Always check your syntax; missing the `-o` flag will overwrite the original file instead of creating `b`.
* Read more:

  ```bash
  man diff
  man patch
  ```

**🧩 Summary**

> The `.diff` file is like a blueprint.
> The `patch` command reads that blueprint and rebuilds the final version.
> `a + sw.diff → b`
